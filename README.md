# self-driving

This porject explores a problem about multilcass image classification. It includes 56,172 images which are related to track. 
The purpose of this project is to help the robot car to predict the direction which inlcudes left, right and forward. 
In this project, I used KNN, logistic regression, Supporting vector machine, Bayesian and CNN to make models for classfiying images.
In the end, I found that CNN model and a highest accuracy and performs best.
